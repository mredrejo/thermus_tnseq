<p>In agreement with Figure 8, we can see that most of the genes are grouped at a Z-score &lt;0, with a peak about -0.5 (<span style="color:grey;">grey line</span>) and a shoulder centered at 1 (<span style="color:orange;">orange line</span>). That suggest that most genes have a low number of insertions and there is a gradient of genes up to a very high number of insertions.</p>
<p>In previous bacteria TnSeq data scores follow a bimodal distribution made up of an exponential distribution of the essential genes and a gamma family curve for non-essential ones, with an inflection point between them <span class="citation" data-cites="goodall2018 valentino2014">(<a href="#ref-goodall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al. 2018</a>.; <a href="#ref-valentino2014" role="doc-biblioref">Valentino et al. 2014</a>)</span>. However, in our data there is no inflection point, so we confirm that there are no clear groups of essential/no essential genes and only a gamma distribution can be fitted (p-value 2x10<sup>-16</sup>).</p>
<p>Thus, to attempt an aproximated classification of the genes we are going to perform unsupervised cluster analysis. First, we will test the number of clusters that allow us to better classify the genes.</p>

<p>The Kmeans clustering is slightly better as its clusters area are closer to the silhouette mean, thus we will keep this clusters and name them as <strong>“Highly permissive”</strong> and <strong>“Intermediate”</strong> genes. The first group contains the genes with higher Z-score mean and the second large group contains the genes with less insertions. To highlight the top genes with less insertions, we empirically select the ~5% genes with less insertions as <strong>“Less permissive”</strong> genes, corresponding to 301 genes with a Z-score &lt; -0.55. The following contain the genes Z-score and classification.</p>

<p>As we can see there are very few genes different between samples. The genes with less insertions in the wt HB27 than in Ppol strain are <code>TT_C1170</code> (CRISPR associated protein), <code>TT_C1360</code> (DNA-binding response regulator MtrA) and <code>TT_C1263</code> (Metalloenzyme), and the genes with more insertions are <code>TT_C0560</code> (Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase), <code>TT_C0409</code> (SufE protein probably involved in Fe-S center assembly), <code>TT_C0135</code> (Phenylacetate-coenzyme A ligase), <code>TT_C1310</code> (50S ribosomal protein L30), and <code>TT_C1600</code> (Inorganic pyrophosphatase).</p>

<p>After calculating the Z-scores, we are going to group the genes by their functions, using COG and KEGG functional categories. Functional annotation was obtained at EggNog mapper website <span class="citation" data-cites="cantalapiedra2021">Cantalapiedra et al.
