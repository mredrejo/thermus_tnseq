During trans-translation Ala- aminoacylated tmRNA acts like a tRNA, entering the A-site of stalled ribosomes, displacing the stalled mRNA.

Thus, functions as a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of Schiff bases and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair.

COG1330;recC;A helicase nuclease that prepares dsDNA breaks (DSB) for recombinational DNA repair. Binds to DSBs and unwinds DNA via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectional helicase activity. Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit recognizes the wild- type Chi sequence, and when added to isolated RecB increases its ATP-dependent helicase processivity;dispensable;dispensable;;;;;;0;2

Labile antitoxin that binds to the MazF endoribonuclease toxin and neutralizes its endoribonuclease activity. Is considered to be an 'addiction' molecule as the cell dies in its absence. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium the overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death. Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Both MazE and MazE-MazF bind to the promoter region of the mazE- mazF operon to inhibit their own transcription.

Addition of MqsR to a preformed MqsA-promoter DNA complex causes dissociation of the MqsA-DNA complex, probably causing derepression of MqsA- repressed transcripts.

COG3550;hipA,yjjJ;Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, first identified by mutations that increase production of persister cells, a fraction of cells that are phenotypic variants not killed by antibiotics, which lead to multidrug tolerance. Persistence may be ultimately due to global remodeling of the persister cell's ribosomes. Phosphorylates Glu-tRNA-ligase (AC P04805, gltX, on 'Ser-239') in vivo. Phosphorylation of GltX prevents it from being charged, leading to an increase in uncharged tRNA(Glu). This induces amino acid starvation and the stringent response via RelA SpoT and increased (p)ppGpp levels, which inhibits replication, transcription, translation and cell wall synthesis, reducing growth and leading to persistence and multidrug resistance. Once the level of HipA exceeds a threshold cells become dormant, and the length of dormancy is determined by how much HipA levels exceed the threshold. The hipA7 mutation (a double G22S D291A mutation) leads to increased generation of persister cells (cells that survive antibiotic treatment) probably by entering into a dormant state, as well as cold-sensitivity. Wild-type cells produce persisters at a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-5) whereas hipA7 cells produce about 100-fold more persisters. hipA7 decreases the affinity for antitoxin HipB, leading to increased HipA levels and persistence,Toxic when overexpressed in E.coli, leading to long filamentous cells. The toxic effect is neutralized by non-cognate antitoxin HipB. Does not seem to inhibit DNA, RNA or protein synthesis, and unlike paralogous toxin HipA its toxic activity is not counteracted by overexpression of GltX. Binds DNA.

COG5113;ybiA,ybiA;Catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in the first two intermediates of riboflavin biosynthesis, which are highly reactive metabolites, yielding relatively innocuous products. Thus, can divert a surplus of harmful intermediates into relatively harmless products and pre-empt the damage these intermediates would otherwise do. Helps maintain flavin levels.

COG5343;rskA;An anti-sigma factor for extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor SigK. ECF sigma factors are held in an inactive form by an anti-sigma factor until released by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). RIP occurs when an extracytoplasmic signal triggers a concerted proteolytic cascade to transmit information and elicit cellular responses. The membrane-spanning regulatory substrate protein is first cut extracytoplasmically (site-1 protease, S1P), then within the membrane itself (site-2 protease, S2P, Rip1), while cytoplasmic proteases finish degrading the regulatory protein, liberating the sigma factor;;dispensable;;;;;;0;1

COG5404;sulA;Component of the SOS system and an inhibitor of cell division. Accumulation of SulA causes rapid cessation of cell division and the appearance of long, non-septate filaments. In the presence of GTP, binds a polymerization-competent form of FtsZ in a 1 1 ratio, thus inhibiting FtsZ polymerization and therefore preventing it from participating in the assembly of the Z ring. This mechanism prevents the premature segregation of damaged DNA to daughter cells during cell division;dispensable;;;;;;;0;1
