<p>Consistent with Figure 8, we can see that most genes are clustered at a Z-score &lt;0, with a peak around -0.5 (<span style="color:grey;">grey line</span>) and a shoulder centered at 1 (<span style="color:orange;">orange line</span>). This indicates that most genes have a low number of insertions and that there is a gradient of genes up to a very high number of insertions.</p>
<p>In previous bacteria, the TnSeq data follow a bimodal distribution consisting of an exponential distribution of essential genes and a gamma family curve for the non-essential genes, with an inflection point in between <span class="citation" data-cites="goodall2018 moule2014 valentino2014 higgins2020 ramsey2020 a.ghomi2024">(<a href="#ref-goodall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al. 2018</a>.; <a href="#ref-moule2014" role="doc-biblioref">Moule et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-valentino2014" role="doc-biblioref">Valentino et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-higgins2020" role="doc-biblioref">Higgins et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-ramsey2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ramsey et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-a.ghomi2024" role="doc-biblioref">A.

However, there is no inflection point in our data, so we confirm that there are no clear groups of essential/non-essential genes and only a gamma distribution can be fitted (p-value 2x10<sup>-16</sup>).</p>
<p>To make an approximate classification of the genes, we will perform an unsupervised cluster analysis. A similar approach was also used in a recent work <span class="citation" data-cites="a.ghomi2024">(<a href="#ref-a.ghomi2024" role="doc-biblioref">A. Ghomi et al. 2024</a>)</span>, using DBSCAN algorithm. However, in that work they also have bimodal curve and more clear density separation of the score index. With our data, we obtained two large groups with wide range of overlapping index that was no very informative.</p>

<p>The Kmeans clustering is slightly better as its clusters area are closer to the silhouette mean, thus we will keep this clusters and name them as <strong>“Highly Permissive”</strong> and <strong>“Intermediate”</strong> genes. As shown in the following plot, both groups are well separated.</p>

<p>The first group contains the genes with higher Z-score mean and the second large group contains the genes with less insertions. To highlight the top genes with less insertions, we empirically select the top 20% genes with less insertions as <strong>“Less Permissive”</strong> genes, corresponding to 0 genes with a Z-score &lt; -0.6. This subset is an artificial creation within the “Intermediate” cluster, not distinctly separate from it (Figure 16), but useful for data representation and discussion.</p>

<p>The separation between the “Intermediate” and “Highly Permissive” cluster is not very clear, as expected. Thus, for some analysis, we will consider these groups as only <strong>one same cluster</strong>. The following table contain the genes Z-score and classification in three groups.</p>
