<p>Consistent with Figure 8, we can see that most genes are clustered at a Z-score &lt;0, with a peak around -0.5 (<span style="color:grey;">grey line</span>) and a shoulder centered at 1 (<span style="color:orange;">orange line</span>). This indicates that most genes have a low number of insertions and that there is a gradient of genes up to a very high number of insertions.</p>
<p>In previous bacteria, the TnSeq data follow a bimodal distribution consisting of an exponential distribution of essential genes and a gamma family curve for the non-essential genes, with an inflection point in between <span class="citation" data-cites="goodall2018 moule2014 valentino2014 higgins2020 ramsey2020">(<a href="#ref-goodall2018" role="doc-biblioref">Goodall et al. 2018</a>.; <a href="#ref-moule2014" role="doc-biblioref">Moule et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-valentino2014" role="doc-biblioref">Valentino et al. 2014</a>; <a href="#ref-higgins2020" role="doc-biblioref">Higgins et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-ramsey2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ramsey et al. 2020</a>)</span>, even in polyploid bacteria <span class="citation" data-cites="rubin2015">(<a href="#ref-rubin2015" role="doc-biblioref">Rubin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. However, there is no inflection point in our data, so we confirm that there are no clear groups of essential/non-essential genes and only a gamma distribution can be fitted (p-value 2x10<sup>-16</sup>).</p>
<p>To make an approximate classification of the genes, we will perform an unsupervised cluster analysis. First, we will test the number of clusters that allow us to better classify the genes.</p>

<p>The Kmeans clustering is slightly better as its clusters area are closer to the silhouette mean, thus we will keep this clusters and name them as <strong>“Highly permissive”</strong> and <strong>“Intermediate”</strong> genes. As shown in the following plot, both groups are well separated.</p>
